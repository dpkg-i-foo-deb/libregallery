A simple app to see pictures in Android

This app does not aim to be ultra useful or beautiful or to be the most feature rich, I just want to learn a little bit about Android development

What it can do at the moment:

✓ Showing pictures and gifs from the media store or basically the pictures directory

✓ Viewing the picture you select in fullscreen

✓ Autoplaying GIF

✓ Sorting by date descendant
